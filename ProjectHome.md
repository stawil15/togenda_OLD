ToGenda treats your to-do list items like events, placing them into available free slots in your Agenda list.

The project is to look clean and be functional, supplying the user with any necessary features.

Currently the project allows users to create "tasks" to be scheduled, but events are only read from the user's Google Calendar app stored on the device.

This project is ongoing and new features and functionality are to be added.
